        <p>Read an array of integers from the user and read the position of the element to be deleted. output the resultant array after deletion.</p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title">What to do??</h2>
            <div class="example">
                <p>
                <Strong>Input:</Strong><br>
                Enter your array size : 10<br>

        <h2 class="section-title">Explanation:</h2>
            <p>

1) After validating the position (index of the number to be deleted), the program begins the deletion process by initiating a loop.<br><br>
  
2) This loop starts from the position of the element to be deleted and continues until the end of the array (one element before the end).<br><br>

3) During each iteration of the loop:<br>
  - The element at the current position (to be deleted) is overwritten with the value of the next element in the array.<br>
  - This effectively shifts all elements after the deleted element one position to the left.<br><br>
  
4) By continuously overwriting each element with the value of the next element in the array, the program ensures that there are no gaps left in the array after the deletion.<br><br>

5) After completing the shifting process, the size of the array is decremented by one to reflect the removal of the element.<br><br>

6) Finally, the program prints the updated array, now containing one fewer element after the deletion.<br><br>

            <h2 class="section-title">Numerical Example:</h2>
<div class="example">
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Let's delete an element at position 3 in an array of 10 elements:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Array before deletion: [1, 2, <strong>3</strong>, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</li>
        <li>After deleting the element at position 3 (1 based indexing):</li>
        <ul><strong></strong>
            <li>1st iteration:
                <ul>
                    <li>Array after 1st iteration: [1, 2, 4, <strong>4</strong>, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>2nd iteration:
                <ul>
                    <li>Array after 2nd iteration: [1, 2, 4, 5, <strong>5</strong>, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>3rd iteration:
                <ul>
                    <li>Array after 3rd iteration: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, <strong>6</strong>, 7, 8, 9, 10]</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>4th iteration:
                <ul>
                    <li>Array after 4th iteration: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, <strong>7</strong>, 8, 9, 10]</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>5th iteration:
                <ul>
                    <li>Array after 5th iteration: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, <strong>8</strong>, 9, 10]</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>6th iteration:
                <ul>
                    <li>Array after 6th iteration: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, <strong>9</strong>, 10]</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>7th iteration:
                <ul>
                    <li>Array after 7th iteration: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, <strong>10</strong>]</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Here we shifted all the numbers. now we can decrease the size of the array by 1. this ensures we only traverse the array
        up to size-1 in future. the last two are duplicates. As this is a fixed size array(statically allocated), we cannot free the last 
        element of the array. so let's decrease the size by 1.<br>
        The Result is : [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">What about Python Solution??</h2>
                <p>In Python, lists are dynamic arrays, and when an element is removed from a list using the `del` keyword or the `remove()` method, the remaining elements are automatically shifted to fill the gap created by the deletion. Therefore, there is no explicit need to perform shifting as in fixed-size arrays, as the Python list handles this internally.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Time and Space Complexity:</h2>
                <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong>O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because in the worst-case scenario, all elements after the deleted element need to be shifted one position to the left, which requires iterating through n-position elements.</p>
                <p><strong>Space Complexity:</strong>O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. ofcourse we declared the maxsize as 100. so you may say the space complexity is O(1) but generally speaking, it's O(n)</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Challenge:</h2>
            <p>Try adding a new element into the array at a particular position.</p>
