        <p>Given a number of days, convert it into years, months, weeks, and days.</p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title">What to do??</h2>
            <div class="example">
                <p>
                <Strong>Input:</Strong><br>
                Enter no of days : 1000<br>
                <br>
                <Strong>Output:</Strong> <br> 
                YEARS : 2  <br>
                MONTHS : 8  <br>
                WEEKS : 4  <br>
                DAYS : 2  <br>
                <br>
                <Strong>1000 days can be divided into 2 years, 8 months, 4 weeks, and 2 days.</Strong><br>

        <h2 class="section-title">Prerequisites:</h2>
        <p>To understand and implement the solution, you should be familiar with the following concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic arithmetic operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Explanation:</h2>
            <p>
                1 Prompt the user to input the number of days.<br><br>
                2 Calculate the number of years by dividing the total number of days by 365.<br><br>
                3 Calculate the number of months by subtracting the days equivalent to the number of years and then dividing the remaining days by 30.<br><br>
                4 Calculate the number of weeks by subtracting the days equivalent to the number of years and months, and then dividing the remaining days by 7.<br><br>
                5 Calculate the remaining days by subtracting the days equivalent to the number of years, months, and weeks.<br><br>
                6 Output the calculated years, months, weeks, and days.<br><br>

                for no of days = 1000, they days can be divided into 2 years, 8 months, 4 weeks, and 2 days.<br>

                - Each year contains 365 days, so 1000 days correspond to <strong>2</strong> years. <br>
                - After subtracting 2 years (730 days), the remaining days are 270.<br>
                - Each month contains approximately 30 days, so 270 days correspond to <strong>8</strong> months.<br>
                - After subtracting 8 months (240 days), the remaining days are 30.<br>
                - Each week contains 7 days, so 30 days correspond to <strong>4</strong> weeks.<br>
                - After subtracting 4 weeks (28 days), the remaining days are <strong>2</strong>, which represents the final days.<br>
            </p>
        
            <h2 class="section-title">Time and Space Complexity:</h2>
            <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong>O(1) because the number of calculations remains constant regardless of the input size.</p>
            <p><strong>Space Complexity:</strong>O(1) because they only use a constant amount of extra space to store variables.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Challenge:</h2>
            <p>Take seconds as input. convert seconds to hours, minutes and seconds</p>

        <p>"Every time we sit down to eat, we have the opportunity to choose compassion over cruelty, kindness over violence, and love over indifference. By embracing vegetarianism, we not only nourish our bodies but also our souls, and in doing so, we sow the seeds of a more peaceful and compassionate world for all beings."</p>
